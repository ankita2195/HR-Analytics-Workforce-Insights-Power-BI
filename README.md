# 📊 HR Analytics & Workforce Insights | Power BI

## 🔎 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end HR analytics dashboard built using Power BI to analyze workforce data of **1,470 employees**.

Rather than simply visualizing HR metrics, the objective was to uncover patterns that influence workforce stability, engagement, and long-term organizational health.

The dashboard explores:

- Employee attrition  
- Engagement & satisfaction levels  
- Workforce composition  
- Compensation & career progression trends  

This project focuses on turning HR data into structured, decision-oriented insights.

## 🎯 Business Objective

Workforce risks often remain hidden behind aggregated metrics. To support data-driven HR strategy, this analysis was designed to answer:

- What factors influence employee attrition?
- Which workforce segments show higher risk exposure?
- How engaged and satisfied are employees overall?
- Is compensation aligned with experience and progression?
- Are there structural imbalances in workforce distribution?

The goal was not just reporting, but interpretation.

## 📊 Results & Business Recommendations

The analysis indicates that workforce stability is influenced by a mix of early-career vulnerability, engagement levels, commute distance, and structured growth pathways.

Although R&D accounts for the highest number of exits due to its size, its attrition rate remains comparatively lower; highlighting the importance of proportional analysis over raw volume interpretation.

Key observations led to the following recommendations:

- **Strengthen Early-Career Retention** – Introduce structured mentorship and clearer growth visibility within the first 2 years.
- **Flexible Work / Commute Support** – Attrition risk increases with commute burden.
- **Engagement Enhancement Initiatives** – Satisfaction levels (~2.7/4) suggest stability but limited enthusiasm.
- **Promotion Transparency** – Slower progression at senior levels may impact long-term motivation.

The focus shifts from reactive attrition control to proactive workforce sustainability.

This project reflects my approach to analytics:

Data should not just inform, it should guide decisions.
